# maze-game
 
This is an application that allows you to play a maze game. I added keypress controls so you can play with the WASD keys. 

- W - move up
- A - go left
- S - move right
- D - go down

I also switched up the canvas colors, scaled it to fit in any screen size and added a goal. There are animations as well, which I borowed from the Matter JS library.
