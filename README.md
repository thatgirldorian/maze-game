# maze-game
 
This is an application that allows you to play a cool maze game. When you move the ball to the goal, you win! I added keypress controls so you can play with the WASD keys. 

- W - move up
- A - go left
- S - move right
- D - go down

I also switched up the canvas colors and scaled it to fit on any screen size. There are animations as well, which I borowed from the Matter JS library. I've played this a couple of times and I'm pretty bad at it haha. :)
